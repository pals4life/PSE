- "build_all.sh" will build the simulation and the CG engine
- "run_examples.sh" will run "build_all.sh" and run the simulation on some example files
- the CG engine will default to rendering each tick; if you have an image viewer that automatically updates the image 
(such as "sxiv"), you can open the image "cg.bmp" in the folder "outputfiles" and view an animation of the simulation
